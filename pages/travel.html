    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" target="_blank"> Spain </a> <i>is bordered to the west by Portugal</i>; to the northeast it borders France, from which it is separated by the tiny 
        principality of Andorra and by the great wall of <u><b>the Pyrenees Mountains</b></u>. Spain’s only other land border is in the far south with Gibraltar, an enclave that belonged to Spain until 1713,
        when it was ceded to Great Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Elsewhere the country is bounded by water: by the Mediterranean Sea to the 
        east and southeast, by the Atlantic Ocean to the northwest and southwest, and by the Bay of Biscay (an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean) to the north. The Canary (Canarias) Islands, in the
        Atlantic Ocean off the northwestern African mainland, and the Balearic (Baleares) Islands, in the Mediterranean, also are parts of Spain, as are Ceuta and Melilla, two small enclaves 
        in North Africa (northern Morocco) that Spain has ruled for centuries.</p>

        <h3> Climate of Spain</h3>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" target="_blank">Spain</a> <i>is characterized by the overlap</i> of one fundamental climatic division <del>(between humid and semiarid and 
            arid zones)</del> by another (the threefold division of the peninsula into maritime, continental, and mountain climates). <b><i>This complexity</i></b> results from the peninsula’s size, which
            is large enough to generate a continental thermal regime; its location close to <strong>the Atlantic Ocean</strong> and North Africa, exposing it to both maritime and Saharan 
            influences; and its mountainous relief, which not only produces its own climatic zones but also exaggerates local aridity through the creation of rain shadows on the mountains’ 
            leeward sides.</p>
