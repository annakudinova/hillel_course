    <p>Spain is a country located in extreme <i>southwestern Europe</i>. It occupies about 85 percent of <b>the Iberian
            Peninsula</b>, which it shares with its smaller <u>neighbour Portugal.</u></p>

    <h2>Storied country</h2>
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Spain" target="_blank">Link to Britannica</a>

    <p> Spain is a storied country of <i>stone castles, snowcapped mountains</i>, vast monuments, and sophisticated
        cities, all of which have made it a <u><b>favoured travel destination</b></u>.
        <em>The country is geographically and culturally diverse.</em> Its heartland is the Meseta, a broad central
        plateau half a mile above sea level.
        Much of the region is traditionally given over to cattle ranching and grain production; it was in this rural
        setting that Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote tilted at the tall windmills
        that still dot the landscape in several places. In the country’s northeast are <b>the broad valley of the Ebro
            River</b>, the mountainous region of Catalonia, and <b>the hilly coastal plain of
            Valencia</b>. To the northwest is the Cantabrian Mountains, a rugged range in which <del>heavily
            forested</del>, rain-swept valleys are interspersed with tall peaks. To the south is the
        citrus-orchard-rich and irrigated lands of the valley of the Guadalquivir River, celebrated in the renowned
        lyrics of Spanish poets Federico García Lorca and Antonio Machado;
        over this valley rises <b>the snowcapped Sierra Nevada</b>. The southern portion of the country is desert, an
        extension of the Sahara made familiar to Americans through the “spaghetti western”
        films of the 1960s and early ’70s. Lined with palm trees, rosemary bushes, and other tropical vegetation, the
        southeastern Mediterranean coast and the Balearic Islands enjoy a gentle climate,
        drawing millions of visitors and retirees, especially from northern Europe.

    <p>Spain’s countryside is quaint, speckled with castles, aqueducts, and <del>ancient ruins</del>, but its cities are
        resoundingly modern. <u>The Andalusian capital of Sevilla (Seville)</u>is famed for its
        musical culture and <i><b>traditional folkways</b></i>; the Catalonian capital of Barcelona for its secular
        architecture and maritime industry; and the national capital of Madrid for its winding
        streets, its museums and bookstores, and its around-the-clock lifestyle. <strong>Madrid is Spain’s largest
            city</strong> and is also its financial and cultural centre, as it has been for hundreds of
        years. <br><em>The many and varied cultures</em> that have gone into the making of Spain—those of the
        Castilians, Catalonians, Lusitanians, Galicians, Basques, Romans, Arabs, Jews, and Roma (Gypsies),
        among other peoples—are renowned for their varied cuisines, customs, and prolific contributions to the world’s
        artistic heritage. </br>The country’s Roman conquerors left their language, roads,
        and monuments, while many of <strong>the Roman Empire’s greatest rulers </strong> were Spanish, among them
        Trajan, Hadrian, and Marcus Aurelius.</p>
